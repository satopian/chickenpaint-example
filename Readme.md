# ChickenPaint integration example

ChickenPaint is an HTML5 port of Marc Schefer's excellent multi-layer drawing Oekaki Java applet ChibiPaint.

ChickenPaint itself is released under GPLv3-or-later, but this example project is released under the WTFPL, 
so you're free to use this project a basis for your integration.

You can get the [sourcecode for this integration here](https://github.com/thenickdude/chickenpaint-example),
and [the sourcecode for ChickenPaint itself here](https://github.com/thenickdude/chickenpaint).
